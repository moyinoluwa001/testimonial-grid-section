 Overview
Overview of the Testimonial Grid Code

This HTML and CSS code creates a testimonial grid layout that displays feedback from multiple users in a structured and visually appealing way. The design is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

  Key Features of the Code
1. Grid-Based Layout 
   - Uses CSS Grid for a structured arrangement of testimonials.  
   - On large screens, the testimonials are displayed in a two-row, multi-column grid.  
   - On tablets and mobile screens, the layout switches to a single-column format for better readability.

2. Card Design  
   - Each testimonial is placed inside a card with rounded corners and a shadow effect for a modern look.  
   - Different background colors are used to differentiate testimonials visually.

3. Author Section 
   - Each testimonial starts with an author section, including:  
     - A small circular avatar placeholder for the authorâ€™s image.  
     - The author's name and status (e.g., "Verified Graduate").  

4. Typography and Styling 
   - Uses modern fonts and spacing for better readability.  
   - Testimonials have different font weights and sizes to highlight key parts of the feedback.

5. Responsive Design  
   - Uses CSS media queries to make the layout responsive.  
   - The grid collapses into a single column on smaller screens for optimal readability.  

6. Footer Section  
   - A simple footer at the bottom displays copyright information.
